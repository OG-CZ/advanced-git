## DATA STORAGE

### What is git?

distributed version control system

### how does git store information?

- at its core, git is like a key value store
- the **value = data**
- the **key = hash of the data**
- you can use the key to retrieve the content

### the key - “SHA1”

- Secure Hash Algorithm - mathematical formulas that turn any data into a fixed-size fingerprint.
- Is a cryptographic hash function
- given a piece of data, it produces a 40-digit hexadecimal number
- this value should always be the same if the given input is the same
  They’re used in:
  - Git (for commit and file IDs)
  - Password verification
  - Digital signatures
  - File integrity checks
  - Network security (SSL/TLS, etc.)

## GIT BLOBS AND TREES

### the value - blob

binary large object - its simply a content of a fle

- git stores the **compressed** data in a blob, along with the metadata in a header:
  - the identifier **blob**
  - the size of the content
  - \0 delimeter
  - content
    ![image.png](./README/01.png)

```bash
echo -e 'blob 14\0Hello, World!' | openssl sha1
```

### under the hood - git hash - object

![image.png](./README/02.png)

![image.png](./README/03.png)

for windows:

### where does git store its data?

- it stores it in the **.git** directory
  ![image.png](./README/03.png)

### where are blobs stored?

-w flags means right

![image.png](./README/04.png)

### we need something else

- blob is missing information!
  - filenames
  - directory structures

if we save a file as a blob, how do we know what that file is aclled and what directory

well, Git stores information in something called as a tree

### tree

![image.png](./README/05.png)

its basically a directory it records which files (blobs), which subfolders(trees) exist and their metadata

a **tree** contains pointers using **SHA1:**

- to blobs
- also pointers to other trees

and metadata:

- type of pointer (blob or tree)
- filename or directory name
- mode (executable file, symbolic link, …)

![image.png](./README/06.png)

### Identical content is only stored once!

![image.png](./README/07.png)

### other optimizations - packfiles, deltas

- git objects are compressed
- as files change, their contents remain mostly similar
- git optimizes for this by compressing these files together, into a Packfile
- the packfile stores the object, and “deltas”, or the differences between one version of the file and next
- Packfiles are generated when:
  - you have to many objects, during gc, or during a push to remote

## GIT COMMITS

commits are just like any type of git objects taht we talked about

a **commit** points to:

- a tree

and contains metadata:

- author and commiter
- date
- message
- parent commit (one or more)

The SHA1 of the commit is hte hash of all this information

![image.png](./README/08.png)

### commit points to parent commits and trees

![image.png](./README/09.png)

A **commit** in Git is a **snapshot of your entire project’s state** (all files and folders) at a specific moment in time

### commits under the hood - make a commit

![image.png](./README/10.png)

### commits under the hood - look in .git/objects

![image.png](./README/11.png)

### git cat-file -t (type) and -p (print the contents)

![image.png](./README/12.png)

![image.png](./README/13.png)

- 581caa → That’s actually a **prefix** (short version) of a **full SHA-1 hash, its fine shorter as long its unique**

if we print the contents of that we get here

- 100644 → this is mode it says if its executable
- blob → stored in the tree which points to hello.txt

![image.png](./README/15.png)

### why cant we “change” commits?

- if you change any data about the commit, the commit will ahve a new SHA1 hash
- even if the file dont change, the created date will

### references - pointers to commits

- tags
- branches
- HEAD - a pointer to the current commit
  ![image.png](./README/16.png)

thats why its fast to switch branches is just changing pointer

### references - under the hood

![image.png](./README/17.png)

## GIT CORE LOGIC

The big picture Git in simple words

1. **`.git/objects/`**
   - This is where Git stores _everything you’ve ever committed_.
   - Each commit, file, and folder snapshot is saved as a **Git object** (blob, tree, or commit).
   - These objects are named and identified by their **SHA-1 hashes**.
   - So yes these objects **contain all your code and history**, compressed and tracked forever.
2. **`.git/refs/heads/`**
   - Each file here (like `main`, `feature-x`) represents a **branch**.
   - It stores the **SHA-1** of the **latest commit** in that branch.
3. **`HEAD`**
   - Points to the branch you’re _currently on_.
   - Example: `ref: refs/heads/main` means “I’m on the `main` branch.”
   - If you checkout another branch, HEAD moves to point to that branch instead.
4. **Branch switching & timeline**
   - When you switch branches, Git looks at the **SHA-1** that branch points to.
   - From that SHA-1, it loads the correct **commit object** → **tree** → **blobs**
     (which reconstruct the exact version of your files for that branch).
   - In short, Git “picks and arranges the proper thing” based on those hashes.

**Final simple summary:**

> Git is a content-addressed system where all your code and history are stored as objects (the real data), and SHA-1 hashes act as their addresses; branches and HEAD are just pointers that tell Git which commit (and therefore which version of your code) to show you.

**Git Core Building Blocks**
| Concept | What it is | What it does | Example |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 🗂️ **Objects** | Actual data storage | Holds everything (files, trees, commits) | Stored in `.git/objects/` |
| 🔑 **SHA-1 (Hash)** | Unique key / address | Points to a specific object’s content | `a3c4f5...` |
| 🧭 **References (Refs)** | Named pointers | Point to the _latest commit_ of branches or tags | `.git/refs/heads/main` |
| 🎯 **HEAD** | Active pointer | Points to the branch you’re currently on | `ref: refs/heads/main` |

### EXERCISE

1.) configure your editor

```json
Set which editor git should use.

This is the program that will open during a commit with no -m flag, a merge, a rebase, etc...

Select from any installed editor. Examples:

emacs: emacs
vi: vi or vim
atom: atom --wait
sublime: subl -n -w
vscode: code --wait
Run: $ $ git config --global core.editor <YOUR_EDITOR>
```

3.) Check out cheat sheet for using less

Tips for using `less` on the command line.

**To navigate:**

- f = for next page
- b = for previous page

**To search:**

- /<_query_>
- n = next match
- p = previous match

**To quit:**

- q = to quit

If you really want to deep dive, check out the man (a.k.a manual) page for [less](https://linux.die.net/man/1/less).
