### Step 1 - Fast-Forward Merge

```bash
1. git branch exercise4                     # create new branch

2. git checkout exercise4                   # checkout in the new branch

3. git --no-pager log --oneline             # shows your entire commit history in a short, clean list without opening the pager view.

4. git merge exercise3                      # Fast forward will happen if
                                            # Letâ€™s say you started exercise4 from exercise3, but then added more commits on exercise4

```

### Step 2 - Non-Fast-Forward Merge

### Step 3 - Setting up for a Conflict

### Step 4 - Enable ReReRe and Merge

### Step 5 - Back up and Merge Again
